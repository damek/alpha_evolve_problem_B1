# AlphaEvolve Problem B1

Read the twitter thread [here](https://x.com/damekdavis/status/1923031798163857814). 

Deepmind made a new system called [AlphaEvolve](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/). They applied it to some optimization problems arising in analysis proofs. I was curious how hard it was to solve the problems, numerically. It's pretty hard! The twitter thread has more details.

## Interactive Demo

Try the [interactive step function autoconvolution visualizer](https://damek.github.io/alpha_evolve_problem_B1/) to experiment with different step functions and see their autoconvolutions.
