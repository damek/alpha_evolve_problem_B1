# AlphaEvolve Problem B1

Read the twitter thread [here](https://x.com/damekdavis/status/1923031798163857814). 

Deepmind made a new system called [AlphaEvolve](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/). They applied it to some optimization problems arising in analysis proofs. I was curious how hard it to solve the problems they improved on. It's pretty hard! The twitter thread has more details.
