# AlphaEvolve Problem B1

Read the twitter thread [here](https://x.com/damekdavis/status/1923031798163857814). 

Google made a new system called AlphaEvolve. They applied it to some optimization problems arising in analysis proofs. I was curious how hard it to solve the problems they improved on. It's pretty hard! The twitter thread has more details.
